The separate actuating device can be another hand-brake, a thumb lever, or a foot pedal, among others.',\n",
       " 'p0080': 'It can be expedient to design an electric scooter based on the expected type of setting (for example, rural vs. urban vs. extra urban) in which that scooter is expected to operate. Accordingly, one can preferably select the number and type of batteries used in the battery pack 104, based upon the expected environment in which the electric scooter is to operate. It should be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art, that reducing the number of batteries, or the rating of batteries, in the aggregate, reduces costs and overall weight of an electric scooter. Accordingly, economic benefits can be realized if electric scooters were designed with the intended operating environment in mind. For example, a scooter frame can preferably include nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries, for example, 30 amp-hour, 120 --> volt Ni-MH batteries. In other embodiments, the scooter can hold about 10 12-volt sealed lead-acid (SLA) batteries, each battery having about a 16 amp-hour rating for a total of approximately 1.9 kilowatt hours at 120 volts. Alternatively, each battery can have a rating of about 26 amp-hours for a total of 3.1 kilowatt hours at 120 volts. Because the 26 amp-hour batteries, however, are larger than the 16 amp-hour batteries, the larger batteries occupy more space within the frame.',\n",
       " 'p0081': 'In a first preferred embodiment, the battery supply 104 includes 30 amp-hour, 120 volt Ni-MH batteries. In alternative embodiments, the battery supply can include lead acid 16 or 18 amp-hour batteries. The lower amp-hour rating batteries are preferably used when the scooter is designed to commute only a small distance within an urban area, whereas the 26 amp-hour batteries are preferably used when the scooter is designed to travel in suburban as well as rural areas with a longer commuting distance. In another embodiment, nickel zinc (Ni-Zn) batteries or lithium ion batteries can be used instead of the lead-acid type. Alternative embodiments can also include other types of batteries or power storage devices.',\n",
       " 'p0082': 'In the preferred embodiment, a battery charger is preferably included to charge the batteries from an external power source. The battery charger can preferably be plugged into a 120 volt, 60 Hz AC power supply or a 220 volt, 50 Hz AC power supply.',\n",
       " 'p0083': 'In another embodiment, capacitors are used in combination with batteries, and in a further embodiment, capacitors are used instead of batteries. For example, ultra-capacitors can take a charge and release it at a faster rate, and in some applications, ultra-capacitors can be superior to batteries in delivering load currents to the motor when accelerating. Power management and electronic controls for capacitors can be simpler than for batteries.',\n",
       " 'p0084': 'Referring to Fig. 13, another embodiment has a tilt-limiting member 552A,552B attached to each side of the tilt-mechanism, preferably to each upper suspension arm 511A,511B. Caliper 552A of the braking member 554 is preferably operable to engage both tilt-limiting members 552A,552B, which as in the previously described embodiments, are curved brakes of materials suitable for disk brakes. The curvature and length of the tilt-limiting members 552A,552B is selected so that regardless of the position of the left and right linkages 570A,570B, the tilt-limiting members 552A,552B remain in a position extending through the caliper, although alternatively, the tilt-limiting members 552A,552B are made shorter. When the braking member 554 is engaged, it locks the movement of both right and left linkages 570A,570B, and simultaneously blocks relative movement therebetween, --> effectively locking out the shock-absorber and spring of the suspension system as well. The calipers can preferably be suddenly or gradually activated or released to suddenly lock out the tilting system or to do so gradually.',\n",
       " 'p0085': 'Tilt adjusting member 554 is mounted preferably to the vehicle body at one end 572 and to the braking member 554 at its other end 574. The caliper 556 of the braking member 554 is preferably pivotally mounted with respect to the vehicle body, such as about hinge pin 576 which extends substantially longitudinally. Preferably, the suspension arms 511A,511B to which the tilt-limiting members 552A,552B are attached are also hinged from the same pivot pin 576 to maintain a generally concentric relationship between the caliper and the curvature of the tilt-limiting members 552A 552B. The tilt-adjusting member is actuatable, manually or automatically as described in relation to the previous embodiments, to rotate the caliper 556 about the pivot pin 576. In this manner, when the caliper 556 is closed to grip the two tilt-limiting members 552A,552B, the tilt-adjusting member is configured to move the brake member 554 and thus pivot the linkages 570 that are locked therewith to adjust and control the tilt of the vehicle, when the tilt-adjusting member varies its length.',\n",
       " 'p0086': 'Tilt-adjusting member 554 is preferably a linear actuator in this embodiment, such as motor-controlled lead screw. Other linear or non-linear actuators can alternatively be used to move the caliper 554 to adjust the tilt.',\n",

    "First we have to explain how does Doc2Vec work and why did we chose to work with it. Document to vector embedding works very similarly to word to vector algorithmsm that are skip-gram and CBOW. Document to vectore captures paragraph or document embedding in such way that similar documents are close in vector space. However, besides regular word embeddings, it includes an ID of paragraph(or in our case a word) which allows us to observe the sense of the document as whole, and not just separate words.  \n",
    "Doc2Vec uses two algorithms called Distributed Memory(inspired by CBOW) and Distributed Bag of Words(inspired by skip-gram):\n",
    "![DM and DBoW](img.png)\n",
    "As it can be seen on an image, these algorithms work very similarly to Word2Vec algorithmsm except they have an additional feature. In DM, ID of the paragraph/word is used as another output next to context words, while in DBoW, an ID is used as an input instead of target word, in order to predict context words. In all our next code wq will use vector size 300, because smaller one might not capture enough data, window size 5, and train the network for 30 epochs. For tokenizing, we used simple_preprocess(), which removes numbers and interpunction and lowercases and returns tokens of the length between 2 and 15[https://tedboy.github.io/nlps/_modules/gensim/utils.html#simple_preprocess].  \n",
    "Finally after data embeding we can find cosine similarity and based on that find the most relevant patents."

    "Finally, we can see that the results are not bad. We got 76.24% of recall@100, and 28.37% of precision. Also the average rank of relevant data is 36.0658. These results are quite good, especially if we consider mean average precision. However, it would be good to look at the data and see the difference between predicted and actually relevant patents. The previous three cells show one of the citing patents (only the first claim) and two cited patents (their first paragraphs). We can notice a very interesting thing. Even though the prediction and ground truth are not the same document, we can notice that the structure of the first paragraphs is almost identical. The same words are used, the same phrasing, they both talk about trailers, however one of them is talking about the breaking system, and the other one is talking vehicle-trailer connection. It could be understood why these two documents would both be considered relevant for the topic, and how could be very close in the vector space. But probably the most interesting part is that the citing document is actually talking about the breaking system of a trailer, and not about trailer-vehicle connection, but it is using a lot of 'connection' word, so we can conslude that for the creation of a map dataset, some word matching algorithm was used, such as TF_IDF or BM25.  \n",
